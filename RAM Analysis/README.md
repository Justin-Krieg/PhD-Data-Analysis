# Radial Arm Maze Analysis

## About
This script is based off of analysis done on the radial arm maze. Here animals are placed in a large decagon with 10 arms protruding from it. Each arm was labelled 0-9 and had a reward in it. There were two arms however that lacked the reward and were labelled as non-baited arm 1 and 2. The sequence of entries was manually recorded for each subject across each trial. __ie. 018374829475638__. This happened over the course of a 3 minute period. Data was collated into a CSV file as below.

| Animal\_ID | Trial | Sequence | Non\_Baited\_Arm\_1 | Non\_Baited\_Arm\_2 |

The script provided here processes the sequence and looks for various parameters:
**Total Arms**: The total number of arms entered.
**Working memory errors**: The total number of times an animal re-enters an arm. This is calculated by the counting any numbers that appear more than once. 
**Reference memory errors**: The total number of times an animal enters once of the arms in the non-baited arms column
**Best reference memory**: The highest count of numbers inbetween two reference memory errors (entering a non baited arm)
**Best working memory**: Similarly, the highest count of numbers between two working memory errors. 
**Best xx memory %**: Standardising these measures to the total number of arms entered
Best xx %**: Standardising working and reference memory errors to the total arms entered.

These parameters were based on the work done in this study:
